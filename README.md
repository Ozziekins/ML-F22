# Machine Learning Assignment 1

**Student name:** Ozioma Okonicha  
**Python version:** Python 3.5 or greater 

### How to run
Open a directory on your local system and run the following commands  
1. ```git clone git@github.com:Ozziekins/ML-F22.git```  
2. ```cd ML-F22``` and make sure you have the `ML_Assingment1.ipynb` downloaded   
3. open google colab or anaconda or jupyter and upload the notebook there
4. run and see the results

> **_NOTE:_** The dataset can be found here: [Regression](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ggim3akt5yjoexb/bitrate_prediction.zip?dl=1), [Classification](https://www.dropbox.com/s/rzbd2vfgmvd9opw/stream_quality_data.zip?dl=1)

> **_NOTE:_** The cells related to pandas-profiling are commented and hence the notebook will run without any disturbances. I have also provided the report as html files for both datsets: `bitrate_profile.html` and `stream_profile.html`. But if you want to view the report, you will first need to uncomment the first four cells after _Data Visualization_ section in both Regression and CLassificiation
